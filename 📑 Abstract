Higher education is being transformed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) into inclusive, flexible learning environments. This repository contains the mathematical modeling, data simulation engine, and advanced scientific visualization framework used to evaluate the integration of AI-driven intelligent assistive technologies (Adaptive Learning, TTS/STT, Computer Vision, NLP, and Neuroadaptive Interfaces) for diverse student demographics.
The provided Python framework generates multi-dimensional, publication-ready figures (600 DPI) that demonstrate how AI can guarantee equitable access to higher education, improve learning outcomes, and address ethical and privacy challenges.
