## 📑 Abstract & Overview

Higher education is being transformed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) into inclusive, flexible learning environments. This repository contains the complete Advanced Scientific Visualization System and Data Generation Engine used to produce the experimental analysis and high-resolution figures for the manuscript. 

The framework evaluates the integration of AI-driven intelligent assistive technologies, including:
* Adaptive Learning Systems
* Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT)
* Computer Vision (CV) for Sign Language
* Neuroadaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

## ✨ Key Features

* Mathematical Modeling Engine: Implements advanced mathematical models including adaptive learning trajectories (logistic growth with acceleration), neuroadaptive BCI cognitive load models, and NLP accuracy logistic regression.
* Synthetic Data Generation: To comply with strict educational data privacy regulations (GDPR/FERPA), this repository utilizes a highly sophisticated synthetic data engine. It accurately simulates a cohort of $N=1000$ students with diverse demographics and abilities, replicating the statistical findings discussed in the paper's experimental section.
* Publication-Ready Visualizations: Generates comprehensive, 600 DPI multi-panel scientific figures customized for top-tier academic journals (Nature/Science/IEEE style).
