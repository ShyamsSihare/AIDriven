To comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR/FERPA) and ethical guidelines discussed in the manuscript, raw biometric and academic data of real students are not shared. Instead, this repository includes a robust Data Generation Engine (DataGenerationEngine class). It uses advanced mathematical modeling (e.g., adaptive logistic growth, neuroadaptive BCI time-constant models, and NLP accuracy logistic regression) to dynamically simulate the experimental dataset ($N=1000$ students across 6 colleges) with precise statistical distributions replicating the real-world findings reported in the paper's Results Section (Tables 1-7).
